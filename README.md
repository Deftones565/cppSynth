# cppSynth

This is a hobby project to learn more about C++, it's a synth that can output sine, square, sawtooth and triangle.
I'm pretty sure sawtooth and square are broken, I'll get to fixing that sometime.

You select the waveform from the dropdown box, Up arrow and down arrow change the octaves. A-; on the keyboard for the notes.
It uses the MIDI standard.

# TODO

* Fix Square and Sawtooth.
* Add visual boxes for viewing the waveforms.
* Add more voices, right now it's mono.
